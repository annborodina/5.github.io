Sen – a Geohumanist sans, is Philatype’s first typeface released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).

Sen is a geometrically constructed sans-serif with a sensible, friendly look. Think of it as a more neutral version of geometric classics such as Avenir or Futura with a humanist touch. It’s unassuming, unique, and most importantly, easy to read.
